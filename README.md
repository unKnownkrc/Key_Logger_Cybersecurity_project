# Keylogger

## Overview
This project implements a keylogger in Python with a Tkinter GUI. It captures keyboard inputs and saves them in text and JSON formats for analysis.

## Features
- Records keystrokes using pynput library.
- GUI with "Start" and "Stop" buttons for control.
- Saves keystrokes in text and JSON files.

## Usage
1. Click "Start" to initiate keylogging.
2. Press keys on the keyboard to record.
3. Click "Stop" to end keylogging.

## Future Improvements
- Implement encryption for logged data.
- Integrate user authentication mechanisms.
- Add advanced logging features like timestamping.
